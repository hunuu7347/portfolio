<h2>Profile</h2>
        <p>
          I started in Tech fairly recently but have loved every step of the
          journey. It is the best thing to see the final product and know that
          all the work I have put through it has shown. Below is a collection of
          my projects starting from recently to when I first started at Dev
          Academy. With the first on the list is a game I worked on with my
          Group Calli2Welli from PowerUp Game Jam just in the last weekend!
